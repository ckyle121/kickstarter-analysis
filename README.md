# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns with Excel 

## Overview of Project
This project performs an analysis of kickstarter campaigns to aid client seeking to start her a fundraising campaign for her play

### Purpose 
For this project, the client, Louise, has an estimated goal of raising $10,000 to fund her play, Fever.  After an analysis of data from kickstarter campaigns, we determine the launch date of a campaign as well as the estimated goal of the fundraiser are two key factors that determine success of a kickstarter campaign. By giving Louise insight of these factors, she will be able to plan her fundraiser around the highest rate of success. Using Excel to analyze current site data, we'll help her gain an understanding of campaigns from start to finish, and we will advise her to set her campaign to mimic other successful one in the same category.

## Analysis and Challenges 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date 
The outcomes for successful Kickstarter campaigns in the theater category demonstrates that campaigns launched in the spring/summer in May/June had the highest success rate; while on the other hand, the campaigns launched in the winter in December have the lowest success rates. One can also notice a spike in failed campaigns in the October. In order to have a successful campaign, Louise should start her campaign in the spring.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals 
A little more than half of kickstarter campaigns for plays with the campaign goal of $10,000 are successful. The smaller the goal of the kickstarter campaign, the more likely the campaign is to achieve its goal.
