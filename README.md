# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
This project performs an analysis of kickstarter campaigns to aid client seeking to start her a fundraising campaign for her play

### Purpose 
For this project, the client, Louise, has an estimated goal of raising $10,000 to fund her play, Fever.  After an analysis of data from kickstarter campaigns, we determine the launch date of a campaign as well as the estimated goal of the fundraiser are two key factors that determine success of a kickstarter campaign. By giving Louise insight of these factors, she will be able to plan her fundraiser around the highest rate of success. Using Excel to analyze current site data, we'll help her gain an understanding of campaigns from start to finish, and we will advise her to set her campaign to mimic other successful one in the same category.
