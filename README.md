# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

##This project performs an analysis of kickstarter campaigns to aid crowdfunding campaigns in meeting their fundraising goals 

###For this project, the client, Louise, has an estimated goal of raising $10,000 to fund her play, Fever.  After an analysis of data from kickstarter campaigns, we determine the launch date of a campaign as well as the estimated goal of the fundraiser are two key factors that determine success of a kickstarter campaign. By giving Louise insight of these factors, she will be able to plan her fundraiser around the highest rate of success.
