# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
##This project performs an analysis of kickstarter campaigns to aid crowdfunding campaigns in meeting their fundraising goals 
###For this project, the client, Louise, has an estimated goal of raising $10,000 to fund her play, Fever. In order to help her achieve her fundraising goal, we determine that there are specific factors such as campaign launch date and estimated goals of the campaign that play a role in making a kickstarter campaign successful. We use each of these insights to help Louise plan her kickstarter campaign accordingly to help her achieve success.
